# V3CN - A Library That Makes You Feel Awesome

Welcome to V3CN! We provide components that are easily available for use in the market elsewhere. Combined with our npx utility, it is very easy to get started in any type of project, whether it is React or Next.js.

## Getting Started

To use our components, follow these steps:

1. **Install Your Modules**: Begin by installing the necessary modules using:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Use Our Utility**: After installation, run our npx utility. It automatically detects your node modules to assess which type of project you are using (React or Next.js).

3. **Compatibility**: We are compatible with all routing and folder structures in both React and Next.js, making integration seamless.

4. **Need Help?**: If you encounter any issues, feel free to DM me on Twitter [@vineetwts](https://x.com/vineetwts) or shoot me an email at [vineetagarwal.now@gmail.com](mailto:vineetagarwal.now@gmail.com).
